# tf_pip_whl
TensorFlow 2.1.0.whl file to install with pip (Ubuntu)

Install TensorFlow 2.1.0 for Ubuntu 19.10 with the following specs:
    - Intel Celeron N3060 1.60GHz 
    - 8GB DDR3L RAM
    - 64-bit OS

Unfortunately, there are a lot of PC´s which have been left behind current TensorFlow versions (In this case, due to AVX instructions added after tf 1.6) this is why I built a pip package made to be installed on PC´s with 'old' processors (Or not powerful like i5-i7 Intel series)

Feel free to use and distribute 'tf_nightly-2.1.0-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl' on your laptop/desktop
